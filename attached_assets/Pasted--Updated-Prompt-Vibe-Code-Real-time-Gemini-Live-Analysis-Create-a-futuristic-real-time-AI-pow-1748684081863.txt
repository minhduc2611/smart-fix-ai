✅ Updated Prompt (Vibe Code + Real-time Gemini Live Analysis)
"Create a futuristic, real-time AI-powered support app called SmartFix AI, designed for technicians using smartphones or smart glasses in the field.

The vibe: Industrial precision meets sci-fi intelligence. A calm, dark interface with neon blue accents. Feels like using JARVIS in a factory setting.

Core Experience: Real-time Video Analysis via Gemini

When the technician opens the camera, the app activates Gemini Live Stream.

Gemini watches the environment through the camera — identifying tools, machine parts, components, warning lights, etc.

It understands context: type of equipment, likely failure, missing parts, and previous history from the knowledge base.

It matches the visual input with OEM documents, past repair logs, and known issues.

Then it explains the issue clearly to the technician in natural voice, e.g.:

“This is a hydraulic regulator. The pressure valve appears misaligned. This is a common fault in Model HX-300 after 500 hours.”

Once understood, it begins speaking repair instructions step by step, waiting for confirmation to proceed.

Example:

“Step 1: Disconnect the power. Confirm when ready.”
“Step 2: Use a torque wrench to loosen the top bolts.”
“Step 3: Realign the valve shaft to match the central pin.”

UI/UX Style:

Split screen: live video on top, voice-synced instructions below.

Voice interaction: technician can say “Done”, “Repeat step”, or “Show me diagram”.

AI visual overlays highlight parts in the live feed.

Emergency button for quick expert call (fallback).

Data is logged silently in the background: voice, steps, duration.

Backend & AI Architecture:

Live Video Feed Ingestion using Gemini multimodal API.

Real-Time Scene Understanding:

Computer Vision: part detection, anomaly spotting (YOLO, CLIP).

NLP: repair doc parsing (LangChain + Gemini embeddings).

TTS: Realistic speech guidance (Google TTS / ElevenLabs).

ASR: Technician voice feedback (Whisper or Gemini voice input).

Contextual Matching Engine to suggest solution paths.

Logging System for repair trace, voice responses, time per step.

Database:

PostgreSQL for structured data (users, machines, repair sessions).

Pinecone or Weaviate for semantic search in documents, past cases, and parts.

S3 or Cloud Storage for video/audio session logs.

Tagline for Splash Screen:

SmartFix AI – Your Eyes, Your Voice, Your Expert.

Tech Stack Summary:

Frontend: React Native + WebRTC

Backend: FastAPI or Node.js

AI: Gemini Live Stream + Whisper + TTS

DB: PostgreSQL + Vector DB + Cloud Storage

Hosting: GCP or Vercel + Firebase for quick prototyping"**
